# Q1 Find the missing number

### Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
A[] = {6,1,2,8,3,4,7,10,5}
Output: 9

## Your Task :
### You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function MissingNumber() that takes array and N as input  parameters and returns the value of the missing number.

# Q2 Find duplicates in an array

### Given an array a of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array. Return the answer in ascending order. If no such element is found, return list containing [-1]. 

Note: The extra space is only for the array to be returned. Try and perform all operations within the provided array. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
a[] = {0,3,1,2}
Output: 
-1
Explanation: 
There is no repeating element in the array. Therefore output is -1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
a[] = {2,3,1,2,3}
Output: 
2 3 
Explanation: 
2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.

## Your Task:
### Complete the function duplicates() which takes array a[] and n as input as parameters and returns a list of elements that occur more than once in the given array in a sorted manner. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= N-1, for each valid i
